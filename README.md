# TCAssignment


#### Assumptions

*	Simple ui , no need to take care of all the corneres of the UX

* 	No need to structure the code in architectural pattern like MVVM , VIPER or Clean Swift etc.

*	 TDD is not rquired

*	 Web content should be downloaded as part of each request

*	 As the this a simple app, in-line documentation in the code is not required

*  For asynchronous request I have used GCD, where 'Operation que' was another option but for this requirement GCD is more suitable
